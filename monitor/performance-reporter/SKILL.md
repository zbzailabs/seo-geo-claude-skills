# Performance Reporter

Aggregates SEO/GEO data, builds stakeholder reports, benchmarks goals/competitors, calculates ROI, and turns deltas into prioritized recommendations.

## Quick Start

```text
Create an SEO performance report for [domain] for [time period]
Generate an executive summary of SEO performance for [month/quarter]
Create a GEO visibility report for [domain]
Generate a content performance report
```

## Skill Contract

**Expected output**: a delta summary, alert/report output, and a short handoff summary ready for `memory/monitoring/`.

- **Reads**: current and prior-period metrics across traffic/rankings/authority/content, report audience, date range, and any user-provided or tool data.
- **Writes**: a user-facing monitoring deliverable plus a reusable summary that can be stored under `memory/monitoring/`.
- **Promotes**: significant changes, confirmed anomalies, follow-up actions, and pending decisions to `memory/open-loops.md`.
- **Done when**: each in-scope section (traffic, rankings, GEO, authority, backlinks, content) is present or marked "Not yet evaluated"; every metric is source-tagged and compared to the prior period; and recommendations carry owner, priority, and expected impact.
- **Primary next skill**: use the `Next Best Skill` below when a change needs action.

### Handoff Summary

> Emit the standard shape from [skill-contract.md §Handoff Summary Format](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/skill-contract.md).

## Data Sources

All integrations optional (see [CONNECTORS.md](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/CONNECTORS.md)). With tools connected, aggregates traffic from ~~analytics, search data from ~~search console, rankings/backlinks from ~~SEO tool, and AI visibility from ~~AI monitor. Without tools, ask user for analytics exports, Search Console data, ranking data, and KPIs.

## Decision Gates

**Stop and ask the user when:**
- No reporting period or comparison period can be determined and none is in context — offer: (1) last 30 days vs prior 30, (2) last calendar month vs prior month, (3) a custom range. A period comparison is required, not optional.

**Continue silently (never stop for):**
- A section's source data is missing — mark that section "Not yet evaluated" and proceed; do not fabricate the metric.
- Audience not stated — default to the executive template and note the assumption.

## Instructions

When a user requests a performance report, use [Report Output Templates](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/monitor/performance-reporter/references/report-output-templates.md) and cover:

1. **Define Report Parameters** — Domain, period, comparison period, report type, audience, focus areas, and data freshness.
2. **Create Executive Summary** — Overall rating, wins, watch areas, required actions, metrics at a glance (traffic, rankings, conversions, DA/authority, AI citations), and SEO ROI; tag each metric Measured / User-provided / Estimated.
3. **Report Organic Traffic** — Sessions, users, pageviews, engagement/bounce, trend visualization, source/device split, top pages, each figure source-tagged.
4. **Report Keyword Rankings** — Position ranges, distribution change, top improvements/declines, SERP features. For raw position-by-position deltas, defer to rank-tracker rather than recomputing here.
5. **Report GEO/AI Performance** — AI citation overview, citations by topic, GEO wins, and optimization opportunities.
6. **Report Domain Authority (CITE)** — Include CITE dimension scores and veto status when available; otherwise mark "Not yet evaluated."
7. **Report Content Quality (CORE-EEAT)** — Include average scores and trends when available; otherwise mark "Not yet evaluated."
8. **Report Backlinks** — Link profile summary, acquisition trend, notable links, competitive position.
9. **Report Content Performance** — Publishing summary, top content, content needing attention, and content ROI.
10. **Generate Recommendations** — Immediate, short-term, and long-term actions with priority, owner, expected impact, and next-period goals.
11. **Compile Full Report** — Add table of contents, appendix, data sources, methodology, and glossary.

Label every metric **Measured** (tool/export), **User-provided**, or **Estimated** (model inference); never present an estimate as measured; if a required metric is unavailable, mark it N/A — do not invent it.

## Example

Sample output: an executive summary with overall status, metrics-at-a-glance for traffic/rankings/conversions/authority/AI citations, SEO ROI, and immediate/month/quarter actions with owners and dates.

## Tips for Success

Lead with insights, compare periods, state data freshness, include owner/deadline/impact for actions, tailor depth to audience, and track GEO/AI citation metrics when in scope.

### Save Results

Ask "Save these results?" If yes, write to `memory/monitoring/` — see [Skill Contract](https://github.com/aaron-he-zhu/seo-geo-claude-skills/blob/main/references/skill-contract.md) §Save Results Template.
